# Mixins and the Dom

Abstracting content using minxins and some DOM handling.
Taking a look at being able to abstract and reuse logic across our components and learn how to handle DOM from within the components

* Mixins
* PureRender mixin
* React and the DOM
* Refs

## Bookstore Enhancements
Will look to seperate code, and break up and have inclusions :- learnings are all taking from the packet react download.
Looking to enhace the previous bookstore app in Chapter 04.

* Add a timeout to the cart
* Show the timer to user
* Complete order within 15 minutes

## Adding a Modal
Once we time out, it will be nice to use Bootstrap's Modal function, and redirect to the begining of the flow.

* Create a Modal React Component based on Bootstrap Modal
* Invoke display from alertCartTimout
* Display the first page and reset data
