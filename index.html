    <p>Of Note: - As the book is written based on version 0.13 - there needs to be some change to written code</p>
    <p>As part of a later version - around version 15 of React - React was split into the core and the DOM - therefore you need to include react-dom, and babel lines 7 &amp; 8 of this file.</p>
